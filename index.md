## Class Time and Location

Lecture: 3:30-5pm PT Monday at Latimer 120

## Course Description

Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) including ChatGPT have ushered the world into a new era with rich new capabilities for wide-ranging application domains. At the same time, there is little understanding of how these new capabilities emerge, their limitations and potential risks. In this class, we will introduce foundations of LLMs, study methods for better understanding LLMs, discuss scaling laws and emergence, and explore the risks and challenges with these technologies and how we can build towards safe and beneficial AI. In particular, this class will cover a wide-ranging topics including:
- Foundations of LLMs
- Interpretability
- Scaling laws
- Adversarial robustness
- AI alignment and governance
- Trojans and unlearning
- Privacy and watermarking
- Agency and emergence
- Reasoning and mathematics
- Evaluation and benchmarking

This is a variable-unit course.
All enrolled students are expected to participate in lectures in person.
Students enrolling in one unit are expected to submit an article that summarizes one of the lectures.
Students enrolling in more than one unit are expected to submit a lab assignment and a project instead of the article.
The project of students enrolling in 2 units should have a written report, which can be a survey in a certain area related to LLMs.
The project of students enrolling in 3 units should also have an implementation (coding) component that programmatically interacts with LLMs, and the project of students enrolling in 4 units should have a very significant implementation component with the potential for either real world impacts or intellectual contributions.
The grade breakdowns for students enrolled in different units are the following:

|                              | 1 unit | 2 units | 3/4 units |
|------------------------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Participation                | 50%    | 20%     | 10%       |
| Article                      | 50%    |         |           |
| Lab                          |        | 20%     | 10%       |
| Project                      |        |         |           |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;*Proposal*       |        | 10%     | 10%       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;*Milestone*      |        | 10%     | 10%       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;*Presentation*   |        | 25%     | 25%       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;*Report*         |        | 15%     | 15%       |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;*Implementation* |        |         | 20%       |
